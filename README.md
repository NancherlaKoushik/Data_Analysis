Data Analytics Project:
This repository contains my implementation of the Data Analytics project based on Luke Barousse's excellent tutorial on YouTube. The tutorial provided a comprehensive overview of data analysis, and this repository serves as my learning journal and a demonstration of the skills I acquired.

Acknowledgements:
A huge thanks to Luke Barousse for his insightful and beginner-friendly tutorial. His step-by-step guidance made complex concepts approachable, and his teaching style kept me motivated throughout the learning process.

What I Learned:
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing and inconsistent data.
   - Transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Creating insightful visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Understanding how to communicate data-driven insights effectively.

3. Data Analysis:
   - Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Using statistical measures to summarize and interpret datasets.

4. Python Programming:
   - Writing efficient and reusable code.
   - Working with libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analytics-project.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore the analysis.
